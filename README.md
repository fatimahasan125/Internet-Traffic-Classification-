# Internet-Traffic-Classification-
An Internet Traffic Classification tool developed in Python to analyze the type of packets flowing over the internet

We have used PyQt5 to develop the GUI for this application. You can click on start capturing to start capturing the packets being sent over your wifi. Clicking on stop capturing stops this process after which you can visualize the results in a pie chart, bar graph or a simple table. An example of each of these is given below:
